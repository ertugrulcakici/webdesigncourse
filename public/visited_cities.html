          <h3>Czech Republic, Prague</h3>
          <p>
            At first times of our erasmus, my friend and I decided to go on a
            spontaneous trip to Prague for two days. Despite the short stay, we
            were able to see and experience so much of this stunning city. We
            walked through the winding streets of the Old Town, admiring the
            historic buildings and charming cafes. We visited the famous Charles
            Bridge and were captivated by the breathtaking views of the Vltava
            River. In the evening, we dined on traditional Czech cuisine and
            enjoyed a night out at a local bar. Although our time in Prague was
            brief, it was a trip that we will always cherish and remember
            fondly.

          <h3>Italy, Venice</h3>
          <p>
            During our time in Erasmus, my friend and I decided to take a trip
            to Venice. It was one of the most enchanting cities we had ever
            visited. We wandered through the winding streets and narrow canals,
            marveling at the beauty of the old buildings and bridges. We took a
            gondola ride and were serenaded by a charming gondolier as we glided
            through the shimmering waters. We also visited the famous Piazza San
            Marco, where we were mesmerized by the intricate details of the
            Basilica di San Marco and the ornate architecture of the Doge's
            Palace. We indulged in delicious Italian food and gelato, and soaked
            up the lively atmosphere of the city. It was a magical trip that we
            will always remember fondly.

          <h3>Italy, Florence</h3>
          <p>
            Florence, the birthplace of Renaissance, was a city that fascinated
            me from the moment I stepped into its historic center. Walking
            through the narrow streets lined with palaces and cathedrals, I felt
            as though I was transported back in time to the 15th century when
            Florence was at its peak. My friend and I spent our days admiring
            the masterpieces of Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and Botticelli
            in the Uffizi Gallery and the Accademia Gallery. We also enjoyed
            strolling through the Boboli Gardens, where we were greeted with
            stunning views of the city. In the evenings, we savored delicious
            Tuscan cuisine and watched the sunset over the Arno River from the
            Ponte Vecchio. Florence was a city that left a lasting impression on
            me, and I knew I would always cherish the memories of our trip.

          <h3>Italy, Bologna</h3>
          <p>
            Bologna is a city in northern Italy, known for its medieval
            architecture and vibrant culture. It's also home to the oldest
            university in the world, the University of Bologna, which was
            founded in 1088. During our time in Italy, my friend and I decided
            to take a day trip to this historic city. We strolled through the
            narrow streets and admired the beautiful architecture of the old
            buildings. We also visited the famous Piazza Maggiore, where we were
            captivated by the stunning Basilica di San Petronio and the Fountain
            of Neptune. In the evening, we dined on traditional Italian cuisine
            and enjoyed a night out at a local bar. It was a trip that we will
            always remember fondly.

          <h3>Italy, San Gimignano</h3>
          <p>
            San Gimignano is a charming medieval town located in the heart of
            Tuscany, Italy. With its stunning views of the rolling hills and
            lush vineyards, it's easy to see why it's called the "Town of Fine
            Towers." During our trip to Italy, my friends and I decided to take
            a day trip to this picturesque town. We strolled through the narrow
            streets and explored the ancient architecture of the town, admiring
            the medieval towers and the beautiful frescoes. We also sampled some
            of the famous local wines and indulged in the delicious Tuscan
            cuisine. As the sun began to set, we sat on a hilltop terrace and
            watched the breathtaking sunset, feeling grateful for the
            opportunity to experience such a magical place.
